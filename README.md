# E-Commerce Platform

A full-stack e-commerce application built with modern web technologies, featuring product management, shopping cart functionality, and a clean user interface.

## 📝 Development Notes

### First-Time Experiences

This project represents several important milestones in my development journey:

- **First Deployment**: This is my first experience deploying a project to production. I purchased a VDS (Virtual Dedicated Server) for deployment, and the IP address in this codebase differs from my actual VDS server IP.

- **First Node.js Backend**: While I typically use .NET for backend development, this is my first time working with Node.js. Thanks to my understanding of backend architecture principles, the transition was smooth.

- **First SQLite & Prisma Experience**: This project marks my first time using SQLite and Prisma ORM. I found Prisma's approach to database management intuitive and enjoyable to work with.

### Design Philosophy

**UI/UX Approach**: While the UI could certainly be more polished, I'm not a designer and design isn't my primary focus. I aimed to create a clean, functional interface based on my aesthetic sensibilities. I intentionally avoided using pre-built frontend templates to build everything from scratch.

**Feature Scope**: To demonstrate my understanding of product attributes and variants, I focused on two categories: **Shoes** and **Clothing**. While I could have added more categories (like electronics) or more attributes (like color in addition to size), I kept it simple to clearly demonstrate the core concepts. The goal was to create a **BASIC yet functional** project that showcases the underlying architecture.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is deployed on a VDS (Virtual Dedicated Server). Note that the IP addresses in the codebase may differ from the actual production server for security reasons.
